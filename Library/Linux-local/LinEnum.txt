General usage:

version 0.981

Example: ./LinEnum.sh -s -k keyword -r report -e /tmp/ -t

OPTIONS:

-k Enter keyword
-e Enter export location
-t Include thorough (lengthy) tests
-s Supply current user password to check sudo perms (INSECURE)
-r Enter report name
-h Displays this help text

Running with no options = limited scans/no output file

-e Requires the user enters an output location i.e. /tmp/export. 
   If this location does not exist, it will be created.
-r Requires the user to enter a report name. 
   The report (.txt file) will be saved to the current working directory.
-t Performs thorough (slow) tests. 
   Without this switch default 'quick' scans are performed.
-s Use the current user with supplied password 
   to check for sudo permissions - note 
   this is insecure and only really for CTF use!
-k An optional switch for which the user 
   can search for a single keyword within many files (documented below).
